What is this?
====
This repository is a fork of [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) for building out support for static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), with the intention of merging it into mainline Yew.

Community
===
Discussion happens in the [Yew discord server on #ssr channel](https://discord.gg/KdXpHFwsWU)

Can I contribute?
===
Yes, definitely! Just reach out on the SSR channel to coordinate. We don't have a formal roadmap, so planning is ad-hoc at the moment.
